Show Down Dice Roll
 
In this project you will write a Javascript program that will figure out your dice rolls. 
 
- Create a `week-2-project` folder, create  a file called `showDown.js` in the `week-2-project` folder.
- Create an `index.html` file, change the `src` or the JavaScript to `showDown.js`.
- Define a function called `fight`. It doesn't need to take any parameters.
- Use `prompt()` to ask the user the name of the monster they're fighting. Save it to a variable called `monster`.
- Do the same with the hero's name and save it to a variable called `hero`.
- Create variables for `villainHealth` and `heroHealth`. Set them both to `50`.
- Using a `while` loop, have the hero and villain attack each other in rounds until one of them has a health at or below 0.
 - Using `Math.random()`, generate a random number between 1 and 20 to represent the hero's dice roll. Save that number to a variable.
 - Do the same for the monster.
 - To decide if the hero and monster hit each other and for how much damage, using the following criteria:
   - If an attacker rolls a 1 or 2, they accidentally stab themselves for 5 damage.
   - If an attacker rolls between 3 and 10, they miss and do 0 damage.
   - If an attacker rolls between 11 and 18, they hit and do 10 damage.
   - If an attacker rolls a 19 or 20, they get a critical hit and do 20 damage.
 - Use `alert()` with string interpolation after each attack to inform the user what happened and how much of each fighter's health remains.
 - Continue the battle until one of the fighters' health has been reduced to zero. When this happens, use string interpolation to declare the winner and loser by name.
 - Bonus: Add an additional condition in case they kill each other on the final blow!
- Below your newly defined function, invoke `fight()`.
- Go to the browser and run the file you just created.
 
BONUS
- After each battle, ask if the user if they'd like to play again.
 - If they answer "yes" restart the game,
 - If they type "no", thank them for playing and end the game.
 - If they type anything else, ask them again.
 
The end result should look something like this:
Name your hero:
John Wick
 
Name the monster:
Scar
